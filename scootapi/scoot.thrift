# Scoot main server/client API interface definition

# See github.com/twitter/scoot/README.md for local Thrift prerequisites

# To Generate files, run from top level (github.com/twitter/scoot) repo directory:
#     $ make thrift-scoot-go
#     We remove scootapi/gen-go/scoot/cloud_scoot-remote/ due to thrift being unable to
#     distinguish between local and included package prefixes.
#     We optimize for the golang library code and remove a main-package client the thrift tool generates.
