# Structures for storing the internal JobDefinition.
# We use this structure rather than scootapi's JobDefinition (in scoot.thrift)
# so that we can add data to the log and not impact the client API.

# We should use go generate to run:
# For now to Install Thrift:
#     1. Install Thrift manually `brew install thrift` ensure version is greater that 0.9.3
#     2. go get github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift
#

# To Generate files run from this (github.com/scootdev/scoot/sched) directory
#     1. thrift --gen go:package_prefix=github.com/scootdev/scoot/sched/gen-go/,package=schedthrift,thrift_import=github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift JobDef.thrift
