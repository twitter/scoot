/*
This is the entry point to the scheduling algorithm
It returns the list of tasks that should be assigned to nodes as per the following description:

Use priority-based task run ratios, P0-Pn, where each task run ratio, Pi, has the semantic that we want to start a
task from a job with priority i, 1 out of every Pi tasks.
Eg: given task run ratios: [1, 10, 50]
 - jobs will have priorities 0, 1, 2 and
 - we will schedule
 - a task from a job with priority 2, 1 out of every 50 times a task is started,
 - a task from a job with priority 1, 1 out of every 10 times a task is started, otherwise
 - schedule a task from a job with priority 0 all other times a task is started
Note: the priority task run ratio array should be a list of ratios with increasing, non-repeating values - lower
priority job tasks run less frequently than higher priority job tasks.

The algorithm also uses a round robin approach to selecting tasks at a given priority level. For the jobs at a given
priority level, each time a task should be scheduled from that priority level, the algorithm picks one task from a job
at that priority level, then picks one task from all other jobs (at that priority level) before returning to select
another task from the original job.  This will prevent any one job from being stalled by other jobs.

When no tasks are available at the priority level whose turn it is, the algorithm will try to find a task at the next
higher priority level, repeatedly looking at the next highest priority level till it has reached priority 0.  If no
waiting task is still found, it will then look successively down the priority levels.
