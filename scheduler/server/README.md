# Scoot Scheduler
## Components:
- Scheduler interface (scheduler.go) - scheduler interface
- statefulScheduler (stateful_scheduler.go) - scheduler implementation
- clusterState (cluster_state.go) - keeps track of the available nodes and nodes running tasks
- jobState (job_state.go) - tracks the state of each job (running, waiting and completed tasks)
- taskRunner (task_runner.go) - starts tasks running and collects the results
- LoadBasedAlg (load_based_sched_alg.go) - the algorithm for computing the list of tasks to start/stop with
each scheduler loop iteration.

# Scheduling Algorithm
(load_based_scheduling_alg.go)

This scheduling algorithm computes the list of tasks to start and stop:

_Given_
- classes with load %s that defined the number of scoot workers we are targeting for running the class's tasks
- jobs with
    - list of tasks waiting to start
    - a requestor that maps jobs to classes
-  we have the number of idle workers waiting to run a task

_GetTasksToBeAssigned()_ is the top level entry to the algorithm. It
- determines if the system needs rebalancing (as per the rebalancing thresholds - see rebalancing below)
- if the system needs rebalancing it computes the tasks that should be stopped and the tasks that should be started
- otherwise, it just computes the tasks that should be started
- it returns the list of tasks that should be started and list of tasks that should be stopped

## get number of tasks to start, and list of tasks to stop:
(when not rebalancing)
### **entitled workers**
(entitlementTasksToStart())

The class %'s define the target number of tasks from each class that should be running at any given time, given 
the platform is fully loaded with many tasks for each class.  We call the number tasks that should be 
running for a given class, the number of workers the class is _entitled_ to use.
When the algorithm is computing tasks to start, it will try to produce a list of tasks such that, when the tasks 
have been started, the running number of running tasks in each class meets the class' **_entitlements_**.

The algorithm finds the classes that have waiting tasks and are under their _entitlement_, computes the unused 
entitlement and each class's unused entitlement % wrt to all the class' unused entitlements.  It then computes the 
number of tasks to start for each class based on the number of available workers, the normalized unused entitlement
%s.  If a  class does not have enough tasks to meet its entitlement, there will still be available workers after 
processing all the classes.  When this happens the algorithm repeats the entitlement computation (re-normalize 
%s, compute tasks to start using number of available workers). Each iteration will either allocate all available 
workers or allocate all of at least one class's waiting tasks or full entitlement. When all available workers are 
allocated or all class's waiting tasks or entitlements have been allocated the entitlement computation is complete.    

### **loaned workers**
(workerLoanAllocation())

It may be the case that some classes are under-utilizing their entitlements, but other classes have more tasks than
their entitlement.  When this happens, the algorithm allows the 'over entitlement' classes to start more tasks than
their entitlement.  The classes under-utilizing their entitlement are, in effect, _loaning_ workers
to the classes with more tasks than their entitlement.

The loan part of the algorithm computes the loan distribution %s as follows:

1. normalize the original load %s for classes with waiting tasks.  
2. compute the total workers that will be loaned (sum of current loaned workers + number of idle workers that would still be unassigned after the entitlement distribution above).
3. compute what the worker loan distribution would be if all of the currently loaned workers plus newly available workers were distributed as per the normalized loan %s
4. adjust the worker loan distribution by subtracting the number of currently loaned workers for each class.  If classes are
exceeding their loan distribution (from step 3) then their adjusted loan distribution is 0
5. compute class final loan %s as each class's adjusted loan distribution / sum of the adjusted loan distributions

Each class's _loan amount_ is computed as the class final loan % (from step 5) * number of workers still available or number of
waiting tasks whichever is smaller

When the _loan_ amount for a class is larger than the number of waiting tasks in that class, there will still be available 
workers after processing each class.  When this happens the algorithm repeats the loan computation for the still unallocated 
workers.  The iteration finishes when all unallocated workers have been assigned to a class or when all the classes waiting 
tasks have been allocated to a worker.

**Note** the entitlement and loan computation does not assign a specific worker to a task, it simply computes the number of
workers that can be used to start tasks in each class.

### **re-balancing**
(rebalanceClassTasks())

Each scheduling iteration naturally brings the running task allocations back to the original class
entitlements, but it could be the case that long running tasks holding on to loaned workers slowly cause the number of
running tasks for each class to be far from the target load percents.
When this occurs, the algorithm _re-balances_ the running workers back toward the original target
%s by stopping tasks that have been started on loaned workers.  It will select the most recently started
tasks till the running task to class allocation meets the original entitlement targets.

The re-balancing is triggered by computing the max difference of the percent under/over class load for each 
class with waiting tasks. We call this the _delta entitlement spread_. When the delta entitlement spread has
been over a threshold for a set period of time, the algorithm computes the list of tasks to stop and start 
to bring the classes to their entitled number of workers.

## selecting tasks to start
The (sub) algorithm for selecting tasks to start in a class uses a round robin approach pulling tasks from jobs that
have been grouped by the number of running tasks.  It starts with jobs with the least number of running tasks, selecting
one task from each job then moving on to the jobs with the next least number of running tasks till the target number of
tasks have been collected.

## exposed scheduling parameters
Scheduler api for the algorithm:
- GetClassLoadPercents - returns the map of className:%
- SetClassLoadPercents - sets the load %s from a map of className:%
- GetRequestorMap - returns the map of className:requestor_re, where requestor_re is the regular
expression for matching requestor values in the job defs
- SetRequestorMap - sets the map of className:requestor_re, where requestor_re is the regular
expression for matching requestor values in the job defs
- GetRebalanceMinimumDuration - return minimum number of minutes the system must be over
the delta entitlement spread before triggering re-balancing
- SetRebalanceMinimumDuration - set the minimum number of minutes the system must be over
the delta entitlement spread before triggering re-balancing
- GetRebalanceThreshold - return the threshold the delta entitlement spread must be over before triggering
re-balancing
- SetRebalanceThreshold - set the threshold the delta entitlement spread must be over before triggering
